"""Integration test configuration.

This module provides shared fixtures for integration tests that use mocked
database connections and FastAPI's TestClient.

Note: E2E fixtures (real HTTP client, app_ready, etc.) are located in
tests/e2e/conftest.py for tests running against the deployed Docker container.
"""


# Integration-specific fixtures can be added here as needed.
# Currently, integration tests define their fixtures locally in test files.
