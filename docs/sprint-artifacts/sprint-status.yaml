# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
#
# SCOPE CHANGE LOG:
# 2025-11-16: Stories 1.3 and 1.4 moved to future enhancements (direct-write model)
# 2025-12-20: Added Epic 4 (Memory Extraction Quality) with 5 stories
# 2025-12-21: Added Epic 9 (Neo4j Removal) with 5 stories - architecture simplification
# 2025-12-22: Added Epic 5 (Scheduled Intents API) with 8 stories - enables Annie proactive AI
# 2025-12-22: Epic 2 (Companion Integration) deprecated - removed from active backlog
# 2025-12-22: Backlog cleanup - removed all backlog items to keep status file focused on active/completed work
#             Removed: Stories 1-7, 1-8 (Epic 1), Epic 5 (Scheduled Intents) with 8 stories
#             These remain defined in epic files and can be re-added when ready to work
# 2025-12-22: Re-added Epic 5 (Scheduled Intents API) to backlog
# 2025-12-24: Added Epic 6 (Intents API Alignment) with 6 stories - extends Epic 5 for Annie integration
