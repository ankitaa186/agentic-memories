# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created

#
# Retrospective Status:

#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
#
# SCOPE CHANGE LOG:
# 2025-11-16: Stories 1.3 and 1.4 moved to future enhancements (direct-write model)
# 2025-12-20: Added Epic 4 (Memory Extraction Quality) with 5 stories
# 2025-12-21: Added Epic 9 (Neo4j Removal) with 5 stories - architecture simplification
